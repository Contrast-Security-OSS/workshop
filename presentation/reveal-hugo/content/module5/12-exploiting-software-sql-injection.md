# SQL Injection Exploits

In this section, we'll exploit the vulnerable application with a common tactic known as SQL injection.

SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to insert extra commands into a text field.  This usually happens because the application does not have sufficient guards in the processing of that text field.  We'll look at an example in this section and show the results in TeamServer.

--- 
## A sequence showing a SQL Injection
Walk the user through the process of entering the text of our SQL injection demonstration.
- Tell them what page to navigate to
- Tell them to enter text
- Show the results in TeamServer
- Navigate to the lines of code

--- 
## Navigate to the application
Let's start by navigating to the application:  http://localhost:18102/WebGoat
