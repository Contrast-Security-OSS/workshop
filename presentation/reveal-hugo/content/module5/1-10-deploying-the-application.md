## Deploying your application
This workshop is designed to have you deploy an application so you can see its data added as part of an onboarding lifecycle.

Your instructor already deployed applications configured with your TeamServer credentials.  You will receive the connection details for your applications as a URLs for each vulnerable application.

---
## What happens when you deploy an application?
When you deploy your instrumented application, a few things happen:
- The agent connects with the remote TeamServer
- The agent starts sending data for the application
- If licenses are available, details for the application are visible in TeamServer

In the next section, we'll look at working with the Contrast Security User Interface running on TeamServer.
